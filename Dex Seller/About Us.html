        <p class="para">As mobile usage began to pick up pace and mobile devices started to position themselves at the centre of our online lives, commentators had plenty to say about the ‚Äúmobile revolution‚Äù. The mobile device has become our communications hub, our diary, our entertainment portal, our primary source of media consumption, our wallet and our gateway to real-time information tailored to our needs. ‚ÄúWhat if the next mobile revolution is all about real-world and context-driven experiences ‚Äî individual needs that are taken care of through mobile, making our lives easier and more seamless?‚Äù Post-mobile revolution (or mid-mobile revolution, depending on your perspective), it certainly seems that way. Jan Chipchase of Frog Design put it even more descriptively:
        ‚ÄúThe mobile phone is used from when you get up in the morning and is often the last thing you interact with at night.‚Äù The magic of mobile marketing lies in the fact that people are seldom separated from their mobile phones. Like Gollum and the One Ring in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, people are loath to be away from their precious technology, which keeps them connected to the world and provides them with timely information. Amazon‚Äôs one-click is almost too convenient ‚Äì I got home the other day to find a guitar in the hallway my ten-year-old had bought on my phone when I wasn‚Äôt looking. The omnipresence and convenience of mobile has brought about a wider shift in consumer behaviour that goes beyond opportunistic ten-year-olds with their parents‚Äô phones. The future of mobile is the future of online. It is how people access online content now. Even as marketers have come to accept that mobile is the future, they haven‚Äôt always been adept at appreciating how much the mobile experience differs from the desktop computers that had dominated digital for the previous two decades. As the consumer‚Äôs device of choice, mobile is almost always on hand. It‚Äôs the brand‚Äôs first point of contact with the consumer, but that doesn‚Äôt mean forcing them to walk around with the entire website in your pocket. Rather, the mobile experience needs to address the context of a mobile user. People interact with their phones very differently than they do with their PCs, and I think that when you design from the ground up with mobile in mind, you create a very different product than going the other way when there is some different structures and parts. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
